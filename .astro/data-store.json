Just thinking of the loading when trying to edit pages now, I don’t know how I was so patient. My previous ventures were short-lived and I rarely updated a site after making it. Or worked on it for more than a month. This time around I want to change that.\r\n\r\nThe first time I bought a domain of my name, I didn’t point it to anything until one day I pointed it to a spinning heart made using CSS. I dunno if I have any screenshots of it but I did not make a serious site per se. I also purchased another domain at the time, I called it The Master Spirit where I wrote self-help articles and stuff and stopped writing after maybe 6 posts. This is my second post so if I make it past seven, I’m setting a new high score.\r\n\r\nI got a free theme for The Master Spirit, made it orange color, got a logo for it. It was like a black biker helmet and I guess the philosophical theme for it was mastering your own soul, or spirit so that’s why I wrote self-help articles on it. \r\n\r\nIt had a commenting system and this one is currently limited to comments on GitHub but you can bet I am yet to implement a commenting system so you can tell me what you think because a one-way communication is delusional. You’ve got to take feedback and work on it while at the same time distinguish valuable information from the unessential.\r\n\r\nAfter that I followed a tutorial for a Portfolio Site made using HTML, CSS and JS. Finished it and you can still find it today [here](https://blissful-clarke-77b2ef.netlify.app/). I’ve kinda butchered it now it was way more proper in the beginning.\r\n\r\nCome 2024 I re-registered my domain name and pointed it to the aforementioned link. After that I made a blog using Hugo and the PaperModX theme and the plan was to host it and redirect my site to it but that project collected dust while I was busy working on college assignments and other stuff (or at least that’s my excuse).\r\n\r\nAfter I finally got a breather and since I hadn’t made any progress configuring my Hugo Blog and also I had heard of good things about Astro, which is a web framework for HTML, CSS, JS, Next.js and God knows what else, I decided to give it a spin and so far, it’s been so good. \r\n### Main Content:\r\nThese days most people prefer visual content and so do I to be honest but I have written in the past and I know the many benefits that reading and writing has so I’m sticking to it. Besides, when videos are too well made with the perfect hooks, fonts, transitions and you name it, I find it hard to trust or trying too hard. Not like that’s a bad thing. \r\n\r\nLike my low-effort (at the time of writing this) about page description says, this blog was written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. Tailwind is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.\r\n\r\nI used the Paper theme and have made various changes to get this look and feel. \r\nFeatures to make this the best personal blog possible would be:\r\n1.\tUse more pictures and gifs to describe stuff, as they say a picture speaks a thousand words\r\n2.\tA more versatile commenting system\r\n3.\tQuality posts\r\n4.\tVoting system?
