  Sharing thoughts on how everything has been.

A blog wouldn’t be a blog without a post so I am writing this for the sake of it being my first post.

Many of you may or may not know me. We have come a long way. I am ashamed that I still am not bringing in any money considering all the time that has passed and I have only myself to blame for that. 

I am listening to Creed’s One Last Breath as I figure out how to configure this site to my liking. Originally I was going for Hugo but I settled on Astro as I hadn’t made much progress on my previous work. 

Where was I? Oh yeah, many, well at least some might be wondering what I have been up to. I will be transparent and honest because what have I got to lose? I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications at Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research, Pune and so far it has been good. 

I have met countless people and made friends who are near and dear to my heart. There are assignments aplenty and a lot of commuting to and fro from home to college. The weather here is pleasant, indeed, way more pleasant than the humid swamp called Mumbai.

The traffic is like wild beasts having a brawl in the jungle while maintaining a sense of order. It’s wild! 

I’ve been jamming to Russ, Avenged Sevenfold and Metallica to name a few. Sometimes I feel nihilistic and find myself questioning what am I even doing and what’s the ultimate purpose of it all? 

My work is not focused as I find myself drifting in and out of youtube videos to continue typing in from where I left off. But you know what? I’m glad! 

I am happy, although it may feel pointless sometimes and the future seems uncertain, for a moment in my life I am at my happiest and could even say my best and I am going to keep striving to be better. And this post is just the beginning! Best believe!
