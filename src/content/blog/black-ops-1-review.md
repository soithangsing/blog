Call of Duty Black Ops Campaign Review
 
Review on 09/11/2024 on PC
By Soilianmang Thangsing

You could call me a patient gamer judging by how late I am writing a review for this game but you can’t write a review of a game if you’ve never finished it and I am glad to say I have finally finished this game, fulfilling a long-awaited childhood desire. 
I played this game on all high settings, 144HZ refresh rate, with keyboard and mouse on Regular Difficulty. God knows how long it would have taken me to finish this game on a controller, I won’t even try to guess. 

I did not buy this game. It was straight off of Fit Girl and fittingly I did not have access to multiplayer OR zombies for that matter so this review is strictly a non-spoiler free campaign mode review.
Our protagonist at the start is Mason, a CIA agent gone rogue, being interrogated and tortured all tied up in a dark room filled with monitors flashing different numbers. The scene is gritty and the game is set during the Cold War, around the early to late 1960s with one mission taking us back to the Second World War. 

Personally speaking, I didn’t have much knowledge or interest of this era before but growing up I have another appreciation for the rich history during this tumultuous time period despite it not being the brightest time in many parts of the world because of the constant global struggle between the Capitalist United States and the Communist USSR. Man, times were crazy!

SO, the first mission thrusts us in Cuba where we kill Castro, or later as we find out his body double. Agent Mason gets captured and gets offered as a gift to some Soviet General Dragovich who then aims to use him for his own agenda. 
Next thing we know is we are getting tortured in some Russian prisoner camp and we make a daring escape out of that prison/labor camp with good old comrade Reznov. Did you hear that name for the first time? Good! Prepare to get your ears filled with Reznov, Reznov, Reznov as you go through the campaign. Anyway, he’s a noble guy who sacrifices himself to save our man Mason from getting caught by the Soviet soldiers.
Apparently, the CIA caught wind of some biological weapon called Nova 6 that the Nazis had developed which the Soviets acquired and had primed to attack the United States with. So, our guy Mason becomes obsessed with killing Dragovich the evil mastermind, Kravchenko his number one henchman and Steiner, who is a scientist or a degenerate prodigy, according to Jason Hudson, who Is Mason’s handler and a player we control for a few missions. The rest of the campaign is just us taking out these folks. 

The campaign is set in different notable locations during the Cold War including The Pentagon in Washington DC, Vietnam, Hongkong, Russia/Siberia, Cuba and the great Atlantic Ocean. 
Call of Duty sure loves staging missions on massive ships because the first mission of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the last mission of this game are set on an important large vessel except this time around there is a massive superstructure underneath said vessel which serves as the base for Soviet invasion once the chemical weapon Nova 6 has been deployed across the United States. 
Besides the usual Call of Duty Follow, Defend and running from objective to objective there is some variety in gameplay but not too much. Well, to start with there are chase scenes, one on a truck, one on a bike and a few helicopter rides where you go “weapons-free” and rain hell on commie bastards.

Maybe it was because I was on regular difficulty but the enemy vehicles like the truck, choppers and some buildings blow up really fast.
Another variety in gameplay was in one mission where we were on a stealth recon jet or something giving instructions to a ground unit called Kilo One comprised of around 4 soldiers marking locations so they move like RTS units telling them to duck from incoming patrol or enter buildings. That was nice. However, the weather cleared up so we didn’t bark orders from the sky for too long. 
The last second level was borderline creepy since it was set in an abandoned office with Mason confused and dazed, and the overall epilepsy inducing set. It was basically a walking simulator so not very hard. I’ve got to say I found John F Kennedy’s accent funny.

Talking about dialogue, there wasn’t a lot of humor or even at all, everything was serious and dry, very military-like you could say and wait till you get to the end till everybody starts rushing ya! It is very fun like your mom calling you for dinner before the food gets cold which is not fun at all. But we’re soldiers in this game right comrade?
About the difficulty, well the teammate bots were downright stupid sometimes unable to provide effective cover and always blocking the way. The enemy was also really brave and often charges deep into our lines.

Sometimes I didn’t know where I was getting shot from because although the enemy bots are dumb, they have a way of staying out of sight tending to spawn on roof tops a lot, which, in a real battle would be the worst place to take position but then again, it’s just a game so I went with it. 
I also encountered two notable bugs, in WMD when we’re rappelling down a snowy mountain with another soldier and then breaking into a tower room front window, the script failed to load properly so the objective didn’t get updated and although the game was running it was effectively stuck because nothing was progressing. I had to restart that level. 

Another one was in Victor Charlie, in the rat hole with Swift the characters including the enemies were blackened out. First, I thought maybe I was going blind but turns out it was a visual bug and I could make the figures from the outlines of their shapes so I blasted all of ‘em anyway.
There was a lot of variety in the guns and I thoroughly enjoyed shooting all of em except the pistols. The pistols are by far the weakest. And there’s guns scattered all around everywhere on every map so you’re never going to run out of bullets or a gun to switch to. The AK47 and its variants features prominently in almost all missions.   

The graphics might have been AAA back in the day, but in 2024 look very dated even with the highest settings turned on, so it was a slight challenge getting used to the visuals and dated gameplay but it’s alright, I’ve played and enjoyed games with worse graphics (ahem, looking at you Minecraft).
Unfortunately, since ya boy is not splurging on this game, I could not review multiplayer or Zombies but the campaign has been great and if you haven’t played this game before and call yourself a gamer, bro you’re seriously missing out. So go ahead and play it.
